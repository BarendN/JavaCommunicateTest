Simple program to demonstrate communication over a network. To run the program run the ComboByteServer.java and the server.file on the host computer and the ComboByteClient.java and client.java files on another computer. 

It works over a LAN network, I haven't gotten it to work over the internet but it should work if the hosting computer has the proper port forwarded.
